Before you start:
- These instructions are for mac users ONLY!!!!
- Must have both Homebrew and Cask installed

Instructions from the command line:
$ brew install pandoc
$ brew cask install mactex
    Install can take awhile.
    It will probably ask you for your password at some point.
$ cd $HOME
$ echo 'export PATH='export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2017:$PATH' >> .bash_profile
- close and reopen Terminal
$ jupyter notebook

Navigate to the notebook you'd like to make into a PDF, open it, and under the 'File' menu look under 'Download as'.
There should be something like 'PDF via LaTex', click on it and your pdf should be waiting for you in your 'Downloads' folder.
